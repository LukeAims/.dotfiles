# Dotfiles

## These are my personal dotfiles and are a work in progress, they include various configuration files and scripts that I use to customize my macOS development environment. I have tried to keep them compatible with all Unix biased systems but there will be some macOS specific scripts and settings. Feel free to explore and use any parts that you find useful.  

### Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don‚Äôt want or need.  Don‚Äôt blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk! This script will install hombrew, zsh and some of my applications. As well as create symbolic links to the dotfiles in your home directory (~/) and set up the necessary configurations.
 
#### shell

This repo contains config for Z Shell (zsh) and bash. As of 2018, I primarily use zsh shell, but occasionally fall back to bash.
The bash and zsh configs are both well maintained.
